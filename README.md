# Etch-a-Sketch
From TheOdinProject.com!

Update: Bug fixed, Etch-a-Sketch now works as intended! Future changes will mostly be inregards to a nicer UI but all functionalities and resizing mechanisms work. This bug took me a while to figure out, but two takeaways are that padding/margin really does mess with grid-items alongside addressing the width and height during the DOM process was something I definitely overlooked!



Mostly completed, the only current issue is in regards to the grid resizing issue, where changing the grid size also changes the size of the sketchpad, but besides that, the app works as intended.
